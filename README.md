# Golletions 📦

**Go + Collections = Golletions**

Golletions is a library of efficient, generic data structures written in pure Go.  
It is designed to be **zero-dependency**, **type-safe** (using Go 1.18+ generics), and **easy to integrate** into any Go project.

Currently, the library provides a robust implementation of a **Red-Black Tree**, with more data structures planned for future releases.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
go get github.com/JustJ3di/Golletions
```

## ✨ Features

- **Pure Go**  
  No Cgo or external dependencies.

- **Generics**  
  Fully type-safe implementations using Go 1.18+ generics.

- **Red-Black Tree**  
  A self-balancing binary search tree supporting  
  **O(log n)** insert, delete, and search operations.

- **Key Support**  
  Supports standard ordered types (`int`, `uint`, `float`, `string`) via a custom constraints interface.
